The Achilles tendon is the largest and strongest tendon in the human body, connecting your calf muscles to your heel bone. Despite its strength, it's vulnerable to injury, particularly in people who engage in sports or sudden physical activities.

In the first 48 hours after diagnosis, focus on **elevation**, **reducing load**, and **avoiding unnecessary movement**. Early rest gives your tendon the best chance to begin healing properly and minimizes inflammation.

## Common Causes

### Overuse and Repetitive Stress

The most common cause of Achilles tendon problems is overuse. This happens when you repeatedly stress the tendon, causing tiny tears that don't have time to heal properly.

### Sudden Increase in Activity

Jumping into intense exercise without proper conditioning is a recipe for injury. Your body needs time to adapt to new physical demands.

### Poor Biomechanics

Issues with your gait, foot structure, or wearing inappropriate footwear can place excessive stress on your Achilles tendon.

## Risk Factors

Several factors can increase your risk of Achilles tendon injury:

-   Age (most common in people 30–50)
-   Male gender
-   Obesity
-   Tight or weak calf muscles
-   Flat feet or high arches
-   Certain medications (such as fluoroquinolone antibiotics)

## Prevention

### Gradual Progression

Never increase your exercise intensity by more than 10% per week. This gives your body time to adapt.

### Proper Warm-Up

Always warm up before exercise and include dynamic stretching for your calves and ankles.

### Strengthen Your Calves

Strong calf muscles can better support your Achilles tendon. Include eccentric exercises (like heel drops) in your routine.

### Choose the Right Footwear

Wear shoes appropriate for your activity, with good heel support and cushioning.

### Listen to Your Body

Pain is your body’s warning system. Don’t push through Achilles pain — rest and seek medical advice if needed.

## When to See a Doctor

Seek immediate medical attention if you:

-   Hear a pop or snap in your ankle
-   Feel sudden severe pain in your heel or calf
-   Cannot walk normally
-   Cannot stand on your toes

Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent a minor issue from becoming a major problem.
