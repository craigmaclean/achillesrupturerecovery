Your diet plays a powerful role in how well and how quickly your Achilles tendon heals.  
While rest, rehab, and physiotherapy rebuild strength and mobility, **nutrition provides the building blocks** for tendon repair, collagen formation, and inflammation control.

Let’s explore what to eat — and what to avoid — during Achilles tendon recovery.

## The Science Behind Tendon Healing

After an Achilles rupture or surgery, your body launches a complex healing process that unfolds in three stages:

1. **Inflammation (Days 1–7)** – Swelling brings immune cells to the area to begin cleanup.
2. **Proliferation (1–6 Weeks)** – Fibroblasts create new collagen fibers to rebuild the tendon.
3. **Remodeling (6 Weeks–12 Months)** – Collagen fibers realign and strengthen under progressive load.

Your body’s ability to produce strong, flexible collagen depends heavily on **amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and hydration** — all of which come from food.

## Key Nutrients for Tendon Repair

### **1. Protein**

Protein provides the amino acids necessary to rebuild tissue.  
Aim for **1.6–2.2 g per kilogram of body weight** daily, spread throughout the day.

Top sources:

-   Lean meats and poultry
-   Fish and seafood
-   Eggs
-   Greek yogurt and cottage cheese
-   Plant proteins (tofu, lentils, beans)

> 🥩 _Pro tip:_ Eat 20–30 g of protein within an hour of physical therapy sessions to enhance recovery.

---

### **2. Collagen + Vitamin C**

Collagen is the primary structural protein in tendons.  
Taking **collagen peptides (10–15 g)** about **30–60 minutes before rehab** may boost collagen synthesis — _but only if combined with vitamin C._

Pair collagen with:

-   Citrus fruits (oranges, kiwis, grapefruits)
-   Strawberries, bell peppers, or broccoli
-   A glass of orange juice or vitamin C tablet before training

---

### **3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids**

Omega-3s reduce excessive inflammation during the early phase of healing.

Best sources:

-   Salmon, sardines, and mackerel
-   Chia seeds and flaxseeds
-   Fish-oil supplements (consult your doctor before use post-surgery)

---

### **4. Vitamin A, Zinc, and Copper**

These micronutrients are essential for tissue growth and collagen cross-linking.

-   **Vitamin A:** sweet potatoes, spinach, carrots
-   **Zinc:** oysters, pumpkin seeds, beef, chickpeas
-   **Copper:** nuts, seeds, shellfish, dark chocolate

---

### **5. Vitamin D and Calcium**

If you’re immobilized or less active, bone density can decrease.  
Adequate **vitamin D and calcium** support bone health and muscular balance.

-   **Vitamin D:** sunlight, salmon, fortified dairy or alternatives
-   **Calcium:** yogurt, cheese, leafy greens, almonds

---

### **6. Antioxidants**

Oxidative stress can slow healing. Antioxidant-rich foods protect cells and support immune function.

-   Blueberries, raspberries, and cherries
-   Dark leafy greens
-   Green tea and turmeric (curcumin)

---

## Hydration and Recovery

Dehydration reduces nutrient transport and joint lubrication.  
Aim for **2–3 liters of water daily**, or more if you’re sweating during rehab exercises.  
Add electrolytes (like magnesium and potassium) if you’re doing longer rehab sessions or using a stationary bike.

---

## Foods to Limit

-   **Excess sugar** – promotes inflammation
-   **Ultra-processed foods** – high in additives and trans fats
-   **Excess alcohol** – interferes with protein synthesis
-   **Low-protein “snack diets”** – slow tissue repair

Think of recovery as a time to **fuel like an athlete**, even if you’re not yet training at full intensity.

---

## Supplements (Optional but Helpful)

If your diet lacks key nutrients, these may help — but consult your healthcare provider first:

-   Collagen peptides + vitamin C
-   Fish-oil (omega-3)
-   Vitamin D3 (especially in winter months)
-   Magnesium glycinate for muscle recovery and sleep

## Building a Daily Recovery Meal Plan

Here’s a simple framework:

| Meal          | Example                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Breakfast** | Greek yogurt with berries, chia seeds, and a drizzle of honey |
| **Snack**     | Collagen shake with orange juice                              |
| **Lunch**     | Grilled salmon, quinoa, and spinach salad                     |
| **Snack**     | Mixed nuts and green tea                                      |
| **Dinner**    | Chicken stir-fry with colorful vegetables and brown rice      |
| **Hydration** | Water + electrolytes throughout the day                       |

## Final Thoughts

Nutrition won’t heal your Achilles tendon alone — but it can **accelerate recovery**, **reduce pain**, and **support stronger tissue remodeling** when paired with consistent rehab and rest.  
Think of food as part of your treatment plan, not just your diet.
